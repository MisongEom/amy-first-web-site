<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
hello web , Hypertext Markup Language(HTML) is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages </strong> and web application.

This document defines Decentralized identifiers (DIDs), a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies. <img src="coding.jpg" width="100%"><p style="marging-top:500px;">In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities. DIDs are URIs that associate a DID subject with a DID document allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject. </p>Each DID document can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or services, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a DID controller to prove control of the DID.

We don't just think about the environment. We act for the environment.
Two billion animals are killed every year due to swallowing dumped plastic garbage. The plastic containers we use for our daily cosmetic products are no different. What is more, a lot of natural cosmetic product bottles are colored green, symbolizing the environment. But is this really eco-friendly? that cannot be recycled.
Thus, we at TOUN28 developed a biodegradable paper container for daily cosmetics to reduce plastic uses. TOUN28 tried over 500 times to develop the world first paper recycle-labelling paper package. We are still on the journey to make a 100%-biodegradable paper container with no plastic cap.
But in the meantime, we give you organic and natural 'Put Ons' in the paper packages that everyone used to say was impossible.</p>
